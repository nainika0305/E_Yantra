The process:

1. Configured Interrupt: Set up the Interrupt Switch on the Firebird V to trigger an interrupt on switch press.
2. Initialized Buzzer: Prepared the Buzzer for activation when the interrupt occurs.
3. Completed Code: Filled in incomplete functions.
5. Handled Interrupts: Set up the external interrupt settings to enable the interrupt functionality.
6. Controlled Buzzer: Implemented functions to turn the Buzzer on and off in response to the interrupt.

This ensures that pressing the Interrupt Switch activates the Buzzer as intended.
