The process:

1. Completed Code: Filled in the provided function stubs in the skeleton code to ensure proper operation.
2. Implemented Motor Control Logic: Developed functions to move the motors forward and control their speed by adjusting the PWM duty cycle.
3. Loop for Speed Variation: Created a loop to gradually increase and decrease the speed of the motors by varying the duty cycle every 10 milliseconds.

This experiment allowed us to effectively control the speed of the motors using PWM, familiarizing me with timer and motor control functionalities.
