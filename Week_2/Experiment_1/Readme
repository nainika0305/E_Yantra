In this experiment, we interfaced a buzzer with the ATmega2560 microcontroller on the Firebird V robot. 
The goal was to configure the buzzer as an output device and make it turn ON and OFF at 1-second intervals indefinitely.

The process:
1. Developed the Code: I worked on interfacing a buzzer with the ATmega2560 microcontroller by debugging the provided skeleton code and fixing any errors.
2. Built the Project: I compiled the code to generate a hex file for uploading to the microcontroller.
3. Simulated the Circuit: Used SimulIDE to load the hex file and test the buzzer functionality, ensuring it turned ON and OFF at 1-second intervals.
