The process:

1. Interfaced ADC: Connected the ADC to the microcontroller on the Firebird V robot.
2. Configured Sensors: Set up three White Line sensors and three IR Proximity sensors.
3. Completed Skeleton Code: Filled in incomplete function.
4. Retrieved ADC Data: Obtained 8-bit ADC results from the sensors.
5. Displayed Data: Output ADC values on an LCD and sent the Center White Line sensor's data to the UART Serial Terminal.
